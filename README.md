Customer-Churn-Prediction

Summary:
Customer Churn Prediction :
Introduction: Churn prediction is a critical task for businesses spanning diverse industries, as it enables the identification of customers who may discontinue using a service or product. In this project, I endeavored to construct a predictive model aimed at detecting potential churners within a customer base. Employing machine learning methodologies, I analyzed historical customer data to forecast future customer behavior.
Data Preprocessing:Data preprocessing is a critical step in any machine learning project. I performed the following preprocessing steps:
Handling missing values: Checked for missing data and applied appropriate techniques .
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explored the dataset to gain insights into feature distributions, correlations, and potential outliers.
Feature Engineering: Created new features, if necessary, and transformed existing ones to improve model performance.
Encoding Categorical Data: Encoded categorical variables using technique one-hot encoding.
Scaling Numeric Features: Scaled numeric featuresusing techniques Min-Max scaling to ensure that they had similar scales and were not biased during model training.
Model Selection: I conducted experiments with various machine learning algorithms, encompassing logistic regression, decision trees, random forests,GradientBoosting,Extreme Gradient Boosting,Naive Bayes,Adaptive Boosting etc... After rigorous testing and evaluation, I opted for a Logistic Regression Algorithm model owing to its interpretability and satisfactory performance.
Model Training:I conducted model training using a portion of the dataset. I employed techniques such as cross-validation to fine-tune hyperparameters and mitigate overfitting. The training data was partitioned into training and validation sets to evaluate the model's performance and implement any necessary adjustments.
Model Evaluation:I evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics helped me assess how well the model predicted customer churn. Additionally, I generated a confusion matrix to visualize the model's predictions. I will continue to use these evaluation methods to assess the model's performance and make any necessary adjustments.
Deployment: To make the churn prediction model accessible, I deployed it using Flask, a user-friendly web application framework. Users can interact with the deployed model by inputting customer data and receiving predictions on whether a customer is likely to churn.
Conclusion: In conclusion, the churn prediction project aimed to assist businesses in reducing customer churn rates by identifying potential churners early. The Logistic Regression Algorithm model achieved a test accuracy of approximately 50.4%, which was slightly better than random guessing. While this accuracy might seem modest, it provides a foundation for further improvements. When deployed , this model enables me to make real-time predictions about customer churn, allowing me to take proactive measures to retain customers.Moving forward, I plan to collect more diverse data, experiment with advanced machine learning techniques, and incorporate customer feedback to refine the model further.Â¶
In summary, this churn prediction project provides a valuable tool for businesses to identify potential churners and take proactive actions to retain customers, ultimately contributing to improved customer retention and business sustainability.
